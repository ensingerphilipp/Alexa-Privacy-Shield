# Project Friday - A Privacy Shield for Speech Assistants

Please notice, that this project ist still a prototype under development!

# What is Project Friday?

To help understand the intention of this project we suggest you to watch the short commercial video we created:

The goal of Project Friday is to secure private conversations while using a speech assistant (Alexa Echo Dot). As of now we only support the Amazon Echo Dot but the general concept is applicable to other Speech Assistants aswell. 
(If we will decide to include other Assistants later down the road is subject to our time constraints.)

With this Privacy Shield the Echo Dot remains usable as usual, the only diference being that you can be sure your private conversations actually do remain really private. To wake up the assistant you will be able to use "Friday" or "Jarvis" (Iron Man Fans where 'ya at? ðŸ˜†) and if youre brave enough - can also train a custom wakeword yourself.

The project was started as semester project at [UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES UPPER AUSTRIA, Campus Hagenberg](https://www.fh-ooe.at/campus-hagenberg/) by the students Philipp Ensinger and Frank Weber. As the prototype was pretty successful we decided to continue developing here on GitHub to improve the functionality and add new features. The Wakeword Engine is based on the git project [DIY-Alexa by Atomic14](https://github.com/atomic14/diy-alexa).

# So how do we build it?

A comprehensive and easy to understand guide will be released in the not so distant future. (summer 2022 at the latest) 
A somewhat crappy draft of a guide is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ensingerphilipp/Alexa-Privacy-Shield/wiki)

<del>Please understand that we do not want to publish an incomplete (and probably really really bad) guide until we have made sure that everything is correct and complete.<del>

# How does the Privacy Shield work? - An overview

We recommend to watch theses short videos to get an overview of how the Privacy Shield works (if you know German lol):

Video Transcription in (broken) English for the time being:

The central unit of the Privacy Shield is an ESP32 microcontroller.
An IÂ²S microphone is connected to this, which is used to detect the wake word. The neural network in the background is trained using the Tensorflow-Lite platform.
To prevent eavesdropping via the EchoDot, its microphones are removed. This is where the privacy shield comes into play. The connectors of the removed microphones are connected to the ESP. Thus the EchoDot is only able to hear something if the ESP passes the audio signal of the microphone to it. 
In addition, the EchoDot offers the possibility to activate it via a button without saying Alexa. The Privacy Shield takes advantage of this by connecting the button's contacts to the ESP. Likewise, the ESP passively reads the IÂ²C communication on the bus of the EchoDot. This is the connection between the processor and the LED controller. This allows the privacy shield to determine what state the EchoDot is in.
In the normal state the EchoDot cannot hear anything and the Privacy-Shield waits for the wakeword. If this is detected, the Privacy-Shield wakes up the EchoDot via the activation button and releases the microphone. At the same time, the Privacy-Shield checks the status of the EchoDot via the mentioned IÂ²C communication to detect when it has processed the request. After that the microphone is blocked again for the EchoDot and the Privacy-Shield waits again for the WakeWord.
If the EchoDot is compromised by an attacker who gains access to the microphones, he will still not be able to listen to any conversations, but only to the few seconds during which a command is given.
The Privacy Shield can be built into any enclosure. In the following example, an IronMan helmet is used. To make it even more visible and to provide the user with visual feedback, the eyes of the Iron Man helmet are equipped with LEDs. Since the Privacy Shield already reads the LED communication on the I2C bus of the EchoDot, this is used to reflect the status of the device on the eyes.
